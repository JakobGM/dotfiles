host:
    # Here we define some context values which often change between host
    # computers, and are therefore practical to use in our templates.
    displays:
        # All displays defined here are used in the polybar module. It creates
        # one bar for each of the display handles, where the bar identifier is
        # the same as the display handle. This way you can start a polybar for
        # the primary screen by running:
        #     polybar --config {modules/polybar/config.template} HDMI2
        primary:
            handle: DP2
            dpi: 96
            status_bar_font_size: 9

        secondary:
            handle: HDMI2
            dpi: 96
            status_bar_font_size: 8

        tertiary:
            handle: eDP1
            dpi: 96
            status_bar_font_size: 12
            
        quaternary:
            handle: DP1
            dpi: 96
            status_bar_font_size: 9


    interfaces:
        wlan:
            # You can also use command substitution in order to insert the
            # standard output of a shell command into a configuration option.
            #
            # This is also used by the polybar template to point the
            # wireless-internet polybar module to the correct interface.
            handle: {{ 'iwconfig 2>/dev/null | grep -o "^\w*"' | shell }}

        ethernet:
            handle: eno0

    commands:
        # Here we define some commands that might change between hosts
        # with different stacks, i.e. systemd vs init, or wayland vs Xorg
        shutdown: systemctl poweroff -i
        reboot: systemctl reboot -i

        # In order to insert our global IP into a template, we can now do:
        # host.commands.global_ip | shell within placeholder delimiters
        global_ip: 'wget http://checkip.dyndns.org/ -O - -o /dev/null | cut -d: -f 2 | cut -d\< -f 1 | xargs'


fonts:
    # Here we define some context values for fonts that we want to use in
    # several different configurations, another common use case for context
    # values in templates.

    # You can use integer indexed variables in order to have fallback values.
    # If fonts:4/5/6 on so on is used in a template, but it is not
    # defined, it will be replaced with ast:fonts:3 instead. This is
    # useful when you dont want to assume how many fonts you want to use when
    # you write your templates.
    #
    # Here we define the main fonts used across our applications. Where 1
    # is the primary font, 2 the secondary font, and so on.

    # These fonts can be installed here: https://nerdfonts.com/
